/**
 * Per-session send/route serialization. Every local send path (maker:send,
 * programmatic bot/guardian delivery, runtime control mutations, card actions)
 * funnels through this map so one session's route decision stays atomic.
 *
 * NOTE: isSessionInTurn is turn-level (single SDK call) semantics, unlike
 * Session.getStatus() lifecycle (active/closed) and unlike the short-lived
 * background-throttling keepalive after terminal.
 *
 * Leak watchdog (PR #2829 QA): an entry whose holder never settles used to pin
 * the map forever — one hung critical section bricked every later programmatic
 * send to that session (outbox retries queued behind `waitPrev`, guardian
 * inbox dispatch wedged mid-`drainBot`, worker idle-close blocked), while UI
 * direct sends kept working and masked the deadlock. Entries are therefore
 * stored behind a bail gate: after `BAIL_MS` the map entry settles on its own
 * so queued waiters proceed. The stuck holder keeps running as a zombie; that
 * is the lesser evil — the critical section's writes are DB-backed with
 * clientId dedup and turn-start guards, the same protections that already
 * tolerate lock-external UI sends. Every bail escalates via `log.warn` with
 * the holder's stage so the original hang point (getSessionMeta /
 * getSessionRowSnapshot / ensureQueueRestored / …) is identifiable from logs.
